        <h2>Products Business</h2>
        <p>
            
            In marketing, a product is an object, or system, or service made available for consumer use as of the consumer demand;
            it is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or need of a customer.[1] In retailing, products
            are often referred to as merchandise, and in manufacturing, products are bought as raw materials and 
            then sold as finished goods. A service is also regarded as a type of product.

            In project management, products are the formal definition of the project deliverables that make up or 
            contribute to delivering the objectives of the project.

            A related concept is that of a sub-product, a secondary but useful result of a production process.

            Dangerous products, particularly physical ones, that cause injuries to consumers or bystanders may be  
            subject to product liability.

        <h2>Products Information</h2>
        <p>
            Many of these types of product information are regulated to some degree, such as to some degree 
            prohibiting false or misleading product information or requiring sellers or manufacturers to specify 
            various information such as ingredients of food-, pharmaceutical- and hygiene-products. There also is 
            standardization. Marketing to entice the shopper is often prioritized over accurate, high-quality 
            or extensive and relevant information.

            Product information is often a key element in the buyer decision process. Relevant factors include trust
             in the accuracy of the information and social normative pressure.Easily accessible and 
             up-to-date medicinal product information can contribute to the health literacy. Online shopping is usually
              more informationally rich than shopping at physical stores traveled to and usually has higher comparability 
              and customizability.

            Production information-related developments can be useful for enabling, facilitating, or shifting towards 
            sustainable consumption and support more sustainable products. Environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) has
             been widely used for to assess environmental impacts across the life cycle of products. There are LCA 
             datasets that assess all products in some supermarkets in a standardized way. Consumers may seek 
             reliable information to evaluate relevant characteristics of products such as durability and reliability.
              Development of 'transparency by design' scenarios have been suggested to "complement the physical 
              product with layers of digital information", improving transparency and traceability (T&T).
              The app CodeCheck gives some smartphone users some capability to scan products for assessed 
              ingredients.Many labels are considered to be flawed and few have the time to "study the true 
              environmental impact of every purchase". Full product transparency is a concept of making the full 
              life-cycle impacts public.An important element that is required for various product information 
              is supply chain transparency, which relates to human rights and supply chain sustainability. </p>
